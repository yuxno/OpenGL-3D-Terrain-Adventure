#3D OpenGL Terrain with Collectible Coins and Shadows

#📌 Project Overview

This project is a real-time 3D rendering simulation using OpenGL, featuring a heightmap-based terrain, collectible coins, and realistic lighting with shadow mapping.

#🚀 Features

Heightmap-Based Terrain: The terrain is generated using a grayscale heightmap.

Coin Collection System: Coins are scattered on the terrain, and the player can collect them upon collision.

Realistic Lighting: Implements Phong shading with ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting.

Shadow Mapping: Objects cast realistic shadows on the terrain.

Camera & Movement: The player can navigate through the scene with an interactive camera.

#🛠️ Dependencies

Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the project:

OpenGL (v3.3 or higher)

GLFW (for window and input handling)

GLAD (for OpenGL function loading)

GLM (for mathematics operations)

STB Image (for texture loading)

#🔥 Future Improvements

Add dynamic shadows for moving objects

Implement sound effects when collecting coins

Improve collision detection for better accuracy
